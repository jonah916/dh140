# Jonah Wiener-Brodkey

## Intro

Hello! My name is Jonah. I'm a 4th year stats major and digital humanities minor from Sacramento, CA.

## Coding Experience

As a stats major, I've mostly coded in R, which I've used for regression analysis, analysis of experiments, and machine learning. Through the major, I've also had basic exposure to object-oriented programming. Through extracurricular projects, I've gotten experience building interactive apps in R Shiny. I'm also a member of the UCLA Data Science Union (DSU), where I've had exposure to Python's `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sci-kit learn` libraries.

## Data Science Experience

When I joined DSU, I went through a data science curriculum that covered the data science process, from data retrieval and cleaning to model-building. I've completed a few projects in Python through the club. In addition, STATS 101C covered a variety of regression and classification algorithms and their implementation in R.
